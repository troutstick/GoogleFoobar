     *  Rules:
     *          Every step must consist of a unique number of bricks.
     *          Every successive step must be taller than the last.
     *  Example:
     *          #
     *          #
     *          ##
     *          31

     *  The only solution to n == 4; one step has 1 brick, the other has 3.
     *  In this case, solution(4) == 1.
     *
     *  REPHRASED: Find the number of unique integer sets whose elements are
     *  positive and sum to n.
