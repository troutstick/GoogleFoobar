My solutions to Google Foobar problems.

## Problem 1:
### FoobarID.java
* Given two nearly identical arrays of integers, find the integer that's in only one array.

## Problem 2:
### Triangle.java
* Cleverly dealing with triangular numbers.
  * An optimized solution probably works in constant time; my current solution is linear.
  * Update 3/16/20: Works in theta(1) now, yay!
### CodedMessages.java
* Given an array of digits, find the largest number consisting of those digits that is divisible by 3

## Problem 3:
### LuckyTriples.java
* Find triplets of elements of an integer array which perfectly divide into each other
  * A bit more complicated than that but that's the gist
  
### BombBaby.java
  * Starting from (1, 1), each turn increase x by y or y by x
  * Find the minimum number of turns to get to some point (x, y), which can be any pair of positive integers
    * If no solution, state as such
